# ML_Project_Without_Sklearn_Library
I Have made such Machine Learning model without SKlearn library 


1.Unsupervised Model :KMeans clustering for iris dataset.

2.Supervised Model:  
    A).Regression: 1) Univariate regression model for user input data.
                   2) Multivariate regression model for user input data.

                   
 B).Classification: 1) Logistic Regression model for user input data.
